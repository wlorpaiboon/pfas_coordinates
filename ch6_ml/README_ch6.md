This directory contains the CSV files used to train and test all machine learning models with Chemprop. Individual molecular descriptors for C-F BDEs (obtained at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ // M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory) are provided in the compressed archive. The ordering of all entries are consistent with bde.csv.

C-F BDEs of PFAS reported in the literature and the connectivity table describing each C-F bond dissociation reaction are named raza (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00476) and sowndarya (https://doi.org/10.1039/D3DD00169E).
