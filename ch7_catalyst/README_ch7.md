This directory contains the optimised geometries mentioned in the results and discussion of the effect of vitamin B12 in the reductive defluorination of PFOA isomers. These include single molecule calculations (the lowest energy conformer of each PFOA isomer in solution phase (H2O) and geometries in the gas phase) and those involved in C-F bond cleavage of perfluoro-3-methylbutanoic acid by a truncated model of vitamin B12. Each single molecule are named according to their abbreviated chemical names (e.g. P3MHA = perfluoro-3-methylheptanoic acid) or according to Scheme 7 in the main text.
