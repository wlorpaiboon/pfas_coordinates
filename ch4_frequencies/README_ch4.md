This directory contains optimised XYZ coordinates of optimised geometries used in chapter 4. The level of theory used to obtain each geometry is provided in the filename with the format: MOL-##.functional.basis.xyz
Density functionals include B3LYP-D3(BJ), M06-2X, and wB97X-D.
Basis sets include ones with and without diffuse functions, abbreviated as follow:
