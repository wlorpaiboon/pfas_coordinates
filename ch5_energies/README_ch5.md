This directory contains remaining supplementary information included as a part of the publication which was used in lieu of the chapter. All files have been included with no changes.
These include:
1.	SI_geometries.tgz containing all XYZ coordinates of the gas and solution phase lowest energy and helical conformers optimised at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory. Effects of the solvent were modelled with the SM12 implicit solvent model.
2.	SI_energies.xlsx containing all gas and solution phase energies from single point calculations.
